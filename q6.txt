1.The change inside increment_int_a does not change the variable "a" after the 
function call because "a" is immutable. Changes made to "a" within the 
function aren't affecting the original "a" outside of the function.

2. The change inside increment_int_b does change the variable "b" after the 
function is called because "b" is a dictionary and thus mutable. Changes made to 
"b" within the function do affect the original "b".
