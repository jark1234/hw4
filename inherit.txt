Write two uses for why you would use inheritance in a program?

1. Inheritance is useful in a program because it allows one to create a subclass 
from an existing class. A program that requires new objects with similar 
characteristics and behaviors could use inheritance to extend a class without 
duplicating code. This allows for simpler modification and maintenance.
2. Inheritance is also useful for heirarchial relationships which is beneficial 
for ogranization of complex systems.
